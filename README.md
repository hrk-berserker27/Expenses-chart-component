## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this solution for Expenses-chart-component.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this bar chart component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
I wanted to learn next.js so I gave it a go in building this project.

I had received the data for the chart in a local `data.json` file from the challenge starter package.

Following were the aspects which I had to take care why building this project:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size(working on it)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file

## Challenges which I faced while building this project
- Struggled to set up dynamic bars for the given data
- Setting the position of the bars
- Responsiveness of the main component-> needs more improvement
- Separate styling for the Desktop and mobile version
 
I tried my best in making the component as close as possible to the main design.

## Future goals
I would like to improve the responsiveness part of the challenge and better JS to set up dynamic bar chart.
